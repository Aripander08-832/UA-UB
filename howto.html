<h1>Generators</h1>
<div>Generators would generates either stars or lower tiers. You can buy them by spending stars, which is a main currency of the game.</div>
<h1>Prestige</h1>
<div>Prestiging is a soft reset where you gain prestige power, which gives a production boost for all generators.<br>Prestige will be available at 1e39 stars, the more stars you have the more prestige power you will gain.</div>
<h1>Transfer</h1>
<div>Transfering gives much like prestige, resets the game, however when you transfer you get a set amount of transfer points. These points can then be spend on upgrades.<br>Your first transfer point will become available at 100x prestige power, the more prestige power you have the more transfer points you will gain.</div>
<h1>Supernova</h1>
<div>Supernova is a soft reset next to prestige and transfer. When you reach 1.8e308 stars, you able to explode your stars and go supernova. When you reach 2.3e362 then you are forced to explode.<br>Each supernova gives 1 neutron star, which you can spend on supernova content.</div>
<h2>Supernova Upgrades</h2>
<div>Supernova Upgrades is the first content of Supernova. These upgrades will boost your progression, including generators, prestige, and transfer content.</div>
<h2>Achievements</h2>
<div>There is another way to boost your things. You can get it by reaching a goal but you need to supernova too. The rewards of this pack is related to the achievement.</div>
<h2>Autobuyers</h2>
<div>Autobuyers is the second content of supernova. After reaching Infinity, you will able to automate the last part before reaching it.<br>
	There is a interval waiting for your autobuyers to take action. You can reduce the interval by 20% down to 50 milliseconds by buying with neutron stars.</div>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<div>Challenges is the third content of supernova. Challenges are special progressions that you have to start over and have to reach Infinity with special conditions. But some supernova upgrades are disabled in all challenges because it's powerful that you can complete challenges easily.<br>
	If you reach Infinity, you have to force to supernova earlier than 2.3e362. After completing for first time in any challenge, you will gain a single reward box, which you can open it but it takes time to get more autobuyers in back-to-back progression before supernova.</div>
<h2>Buyinshop</h2>
<div>Buyinshop is the fourth content of supernova. It's a shop that involves shop features for autobuyers.<br>
	Some buyinshop features are expensive that you recommend to break limit! After reaching million neutron stars, you notice you can supernova automatically in no time!</div>
<h2>Neutron boosts</h2>
<div>Neutron boosts is the fifth content of supernova. Beside neutron boosts, you can able to break the limit of 2.3e362 (In challenges, there always be the fixed limit)! As you gain more stars above 2.6e362, you will able to gain more neutron stars.<br>
	There are repeatable upgrades that increases neutron boost power, which translated to multiplier of production for all generators. Also, it have the upgrade that increases the PP gain by your neutron boost power.</div>
<h2>Neutron tiers</h2>
<div>Neutron tiers is the second content after breaking the limit. Like the set of generators, all neutron tiers are unlocked but have the cost of neutron stars and higher bonuses for buying it.<br>
	First neutron tier will produce neutrons, which reduces the cost of the normal generators. While reaching neutron tier 10 generators, there is upgrades that helps you reach that.</div>
<h2>Aliens</h2>
<div>Aliens is the last content after breaking the limit and before getting 1.8e308 neutron stars which hypernova comes.</div>
